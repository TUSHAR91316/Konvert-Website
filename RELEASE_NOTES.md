## 📌 Version 1.7.0 (Current Release)
*Full Package Upgrade, Live Telemetry, In-App Direct Installer & Hybrid PDF Merge*

### 🌟 Core Highlights
This release upgrades every direct dependency to its latest available version, modernizes Google Sign-In to the new v7 API (Android Credential Manager), bumps the Android build toolchain to Java 17 / Gradle 8.14 / AGP 8.11.1, introduces real-time system hardware telemetry, and adds seamless in-app direct APK updates.

### 🚀 Key Features & Architectural Enhancements

1. 📊 **Real-Time System Hardware Telemetry**
   - **Backend Telemetry Endpoint**: Added `psutil` hardware inspection (`GET /health/details`) reporting real-time CPU %, RAM consumption (used/total MB), and free disk space (GB).
   - **Interactive Status Modal**: Tapping the "SYSTEM STATUS" Bento card opens a real-time telemetry bottom sheet with animated progress bars, live latency ping (ms), and an instant reconnect button.

2. 📲 **In-App Direct Release Downloader & Native Installer**
   - **Seamless In-App Streaming**: Replaced external browser redirects with a built-in streaming downloader (`Dio().download`) displaying real-time download progress (`0%` → `100%`).
   - **One-Tap System Installation**: Tapping "Install Update" downloads the `.apk` directly and triggers the native Android package installer prompt via `open_file` — zero manual web browsing or file manager searching required.

3. 🧩 **Lossless Hybrid Multi-PDF Merging**
   - **Smart Fallback Engine**: Multi-PDF merges process losslessly on the self-hosted backend (`/merge-pdfs`) when connected, and automatically fall back to **100% offline** on-device merging via the `pdf` & `printing` Dart packages when offline.

4. ⚡ **Asynchronous Non-Blocking Document Processing**
   - **Async Subprocess Execution**: Replaced blocking calls with `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()` in backend LibreOffice handlers so heavy document processing never blocks server health checks or telemetry requests.
   - **Startup Dialog Safety**: Wrapped update checks in `addPostFrameCallback` to eliminate cold-launch UI rendering race conditions.

5. 🛠️ **Refined Theme & System Persistence**
   - **Theme Mode Persistence**: Persisted `ThemeMode` (`light`/`dark`) in `FlutterSecureStorage` across both the Settings toggle and the top navigation quick-toggle, surviving app restarts.
   - **Dynamic Storage Paths**: Implemented `path_provider` directory resolution and dynamic folder pickers for full Android Scoped Storage compliance.
   - **Smart Emulator Loopback**: Configured `ConfigService` to auto-detect Android emulators (`10.0.2.2:8080`) while preserving `localhost` and Ngrok static domain configurations for physical devices.
   - **Centralized API Constants**: Centralized all endpoint routes, network timeouts, and file size thresholds in `ApiConstants`.
